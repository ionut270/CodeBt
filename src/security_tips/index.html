					<p>
						According to the
						<a
							href="https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/threats/paper/38790"
							target="_blank"
							rel="noopener noreferrer"
							>SANS CTI 2019 survey results</a
						>, 72% of organizations either consume or produce Threat Intelligence. Although most organizations have
						Intelligence data, they struggle with defining requirements and managing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) as
						a program with measurable output. This likely results from threat data and intelligence being perceived as a
						technical function unrelated to business objectives.
					</p>
					<p>We need to change this perception.</p>
					<p>
						In my opinion, the key business objectives most closely related to threat intelligence are Risk Management
						and Cyber Resilience. Threat Intelligence can influence the outcomes of both.
					</p>
					<p>
						Cyber Resilience itself requires risk management and adaptability. The need for businesses to become more
						resilient is driving the demand for an adaptable security architecture—one that not only effectively
						leverages threat intelligence to improve Security Operations, especially Incident Response, but also adapts
						cyber defenses such as endpoint and network controls to prevent the latest threats.
					</p>
					<p>
						Meanwhile, regulations focused on improving cyber security are driving a continuous risk management
						approach. For example, in 2016, the European Union released the
						<a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
							>NIS (Network and Information Systems) Directive</a
						>, which provides a legal framework to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in critical industries and
						calls specifically for threat intelligence and incident sharing among organizations and national
						authorities. With these drivers in mind, we now need to design a managed process with the goal of creating
						an efficient way to increase the business value of CTI. We can define this process as follows:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Discovering the most valuable data sources</li>
						<li>Using automation to collect, investigate, respond and share</li>
						<li>Integrating CTI into cyber defense processes</li>
						<li>Measuring to prove the value of Threat Intelligence</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>1. Collection, Deduplication and Aggregation</h3>
					<p>
						The first step in the CTI Management Process is the collection, deduplication and aggregation of the data or
						feeds. One of the main gaps at the enterprise level is the collection of local produced Threat Intelligence.
						Local Threat Intelligence includes data generated from analytics solutions like sandboxes and from
						incidents. Sandboxes usually produce intelligence data in the form of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). These
						local sources could expose targeted attacks, and therefore are potentially the most valuable threat data
						source.
					</p>
					<p>
						McAfee’s Open Architecture allows for the production, consumption and sharing of threat intelligence in
						various ways. Here is an example of how our architecture automates aggregation of various CTI sources with
						an open-source tool, MISP. The MISP platform subscribes to the McAfee Data Exchange Layer messaging fabric
						to consume IoCs from McAfee’s Advanced Threat Defense sandbox in real time. Additionally, MISP consumes and
						manages feeds from open or paid sources, providing an entry-level tool to manage the threat intel process.
					</p>

							"
							sizes="(max-width: 835px) 100vw, 835px"
						/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Here is another example of how our architecture supports the aggregation process, this time by working with
						a commercial vendor, ThreatQ.

							sizes="(max-width: 849px) 100vw, 849px"
						/>
					</p>
					<h3>2. Investigation and Hunting</h3>
					<p>
						The second step in the CTI management process is investigation and hunting. Here, the biggest task is
						figuring out how to make Threat Intelligence actionable, which can be done by answering questions like:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Have we seen any related artifacts (IP address connections, Hash/File executions) in my enterprise in the
							past?
						</li>
						<li>Do we have, right now, any devices that have related artifacts?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Before answering these questions, the right data must be collected from the enterprise sensors. Fundamental
						information should include IP address connections, file hashes on endpoints, web proxy, DNS and Active
						Directory logs. These logs provide the necessary data for correlation and historical analysis. The following
						example demonstrates how the architecture can automate some of the key triage steps.
					</p>
					<p>

							srcset="
								https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Picture4.png         837w,
								https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Picture4-300x150.png 300w,
								https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Picture4-768x384.png 768w
							"
							sizes="(max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px"
						/>
					</p>
					<p>
						MISP can push Threat Intelligence into McAfee’s SIEM solution, ESM (Enterprise Security Manager), to
						automate historical analysis. There, it can query McAfee’s Threat Intelligence Exchange server to identify
						which systems executed related artifacts, and where and when they did so. Furthermore, MISP can run
						real-time queries against McAfee-protected endpoints with McAfee Active Response to identify any persistent
						artifacts that are currently in the enterprise network.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here is another example working with ThreatQ. This time, ThreatQ interacts with McAfee ESM, Active Response
						and McAfee TIE to identify systems that have or had artifacts related to Threat Intelligence indicators.
						These various integrations support manual enrichment task and investigations.
					</p>
					<p>The screenshot below highlights the various McAfee integrations as part of an investigation.</p>

							sizes="(max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px"
						/>
					</p>
					<h3>3. Response</h3>
					<p>
						The third step in the CTI Management Process is response. Cyber Threat Intelligence is essential to prevent
						the latest threats and should be integrated into key cyberdefense countermeasures. The following example
						demonstrates an automated update process using McAfee’s Open Architecture, with the Data Exchange Layer
						(DXL) fabric as the key component.
					</p>
					<p>
						<img
							class="securityImg"
							src="https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Picture6.png"
							alt=""
							width="864"
							height="433"
							srcset="
								https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Picture6.png         864w,
								https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Picture6-300x150.png 300w,
								https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Picture6-768x385.png 768w
							"
							sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px"
						/>
					</p>
					<p>
						ThreatQ can communicate via the DXL fabric with McAfee technologies. During this process ThreatQ is able to
						update key cyber defense countermeasure tools with Threat Intelligence to protect against the latest
						threats.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another part of this process step is sharing threat intelligence with other parties, such as partners and
						communities. Most Threat Intelligence Platforms (open source and commercial) support various protocols for
						external CTI sharing. This includes TLP, STIX, TAXII and DXL. These protocols support the automated exchange
						and governance of the shared data.

						automated exchange and governance of the shared data.
					</p>
					<h3>4. Measurement</h3>
					<p>
						Finally, the value of Threat Intelligence can be proven by measuring a variety of outcomes. The following
						are some of the metrics commonly quantified and reported on:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Number of duplicate Threat Intelligence Artifacts removed</li>
						<li>Impact on Mean-Time-To-Respond</li>
						<li>Number of IOCs generated from Threat Intelligence</li>
						<li>Number of incidents identified based on Threat Intelligence</li>
						<li>Number of attacks blocked via Threat Intelligence</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Summary</h3>
					<p>
						The creation and implementation of the right process is critical to the success of Cyber Threat Intelligence
						within the enterprise. In this blog, we defined a CTI management process of Collection, Investigation,
						Response and Measurement. McAfee’s research, management platform and open architecture enable you to
						implement this process and get the best value out of Cyber Threat Intelligence, promoting resilience and
						enabling better risk management.
